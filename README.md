A simple command-line task manager written in Python.

## File Structure

- **task_cli.py** - Main script
- **tasks.json** - JSON file used to store tasks

## Error Handling

- Invalid commands or missing arguments show error messages.
- If the tasks.json file is corrupted, it resets automatically.
- Invalid or non-existent task IDs are handled cleanly.

## Git Ignore Suggestion

To avoid committing local task data, add this line to your `.gitignore` file:

    tasks.json

## Example Output

    $ python task_cli.py add "Finish writing report"
    Task added successfully (ID: 1)

    $ python task_cli.py list
    [ID: 1] [Status: not done]
      Description: Finish writing report
